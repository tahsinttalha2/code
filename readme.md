This repository is my ultimate portfolio that contains everything from my practice to implementation. I wanted to keep everything in the same place to keep me updated and review my progression and hence this step. 

👉If you're interested to see my practice problems, please head to the 'codeforces' directory as it contains the practice problems I've solved as well as my solutions from different contests.


👉If you're rather interested about my implementations, please go to the 'projects' directory as it contains all my ongoing and completed projects. 

Thank you for your time in navigating to my repository!💖
